1. fix CSV parsing
    1.1. ignore first and last double quotation
    "abc" -> abc

    1.2. replace "" with "
    "hello, friend ""foobar""" -> hello, friend "foobar"

2. fix weird linebreak problem
    some RUN_LINE automatically inserts line break, some doesn't.
    after SHOW_OPTION will ignore line-break for some reason.

3. automatic skipping problem
    after selecting an option, next RUN_LINE call fails to wait for getchar.
