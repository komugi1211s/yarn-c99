1. create ADD_OPTIONS
    line substitution again!
    matches with show_options. need to create option struct.

2. create SHOW_OPTIONS
    todo. look through what must be done.

3. create RUN_COMMAND
    substituting must be implemented without too much allocation
        replace:
            text: hello, this is {0}! are you a {1}?
            operand: foo, bar

        to:
            text: hello, this is foo! are you a bar?

4. fix CSV parsing
    simple double-quotated sentence breaks parsing. how could I do this?
